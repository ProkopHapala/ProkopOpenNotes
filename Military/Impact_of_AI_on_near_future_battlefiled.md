## General

Contemporary tactics and weapon systems are largely determined by focus on humans. Artificial intelligence and removal of human soldiers from the battlefield will have tremendous implication for structure not only for construction of individual fighting vehicles but also for order-of-battle.  

## Sizes of military vehicles

Historically the size of military vehicles (e.g. fighter jets and tanks) was largely determined by requirement to carry people. 

## Air Warfare

### Fighter jet vs. guided missile

### Vertical takeoff and landing

Trust-to-weight ratio of modern fighter jets is typically close to 1.0 (often >1.0). In principle this means that such airplane is capable of vertical takeoff and landing on its tail assuming that proper landing gears are attached and that control system can handle it. Historically concept of tail-landing was abandon mostly due to problems human pilots had during landing. This turned down projects like [Convair_XFY_Pogo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convair_XFY_Pogo) and [Heinkel_Lerche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinkel_Lerche).

Modern computerized flight control (fly-by-wire) makes this less of a problem and absence of human pilot in AI controlled aircraft completely nullify the concern.

## Ground Warfare

### Infantry replacement

### Crewless tanks
